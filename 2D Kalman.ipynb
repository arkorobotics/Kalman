    "### Recursive Kalman Filter Algorithm ###\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Filter Inputs and Outputs ####\n",
    "The recursive Kalman filter takes as inputs the previous time-step's state probability in the form of the the mean $\\mu_{t-1}$ and the covariance $\\Sigma_{t-1}$, as well as the control input at that time step $u_t$ and the measurement at that step $z_t$. The filter returns the state probability at that time step as the mean $\\mu_t$ and covariance $\\Sigma_t$. The mean and covariance returned at time $t$ then becomes the input to the filter at time $t+1$, the filter is applied again, and so on and so forth.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Predicted Belief (state probability update) ####\n",
    "The filter starts by making a predicted belief of the state probability at time $t$ from the information provided about the state probability at time $t-1$, the control input to the state transition function from $t-1$ to $t$, and the measurement of the current state at $t$. As a reminder, the state transition function connects the state at $t-1$ to the current state at $t$ by:\n",

    "$$ x_t = A_tx_{t-1} + B_tu_t + \\epsilon_t $$\n",
    "\n",
    "The Kalman filter predicts the mean and covariance of the state at $t$ in the following way:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\bar{\\mu_t} = A_t\\mu_{t-1} + V_tu_t $$\n",
    "$$ \\bar{\\Sigma_t} = A_t\\Sigma_{t-1}A_t^T + R_t $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where the predicted belief of the state is represented by the predicted mean $\\bar{\\mu_t}$ and the predicted covariance $\\bar{\\Sigma_t}$, which describes a standard normal Gaussian probability distribution of the current predicted state, which in this case is the x-y location of a robot in a 2D grid.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the first equation, the mean update, the $A_t$ and $B_t$ are the state transition and control matrices, respectively. $A_t$ effectively describes how the system changes on its own from time $t-1$ to $t$, while $B_t$ describes how a control input $u_t$ affects the state of the system from $t-1$ to $t$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the second equation, the covariance update considers the fact that states depend on previous states through the linear matrix $A_t$, which is multiplied twice into the covariance, since the covariance is a quadratic matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Calculating the Kalman Gain ####\n",
    "The next part of the recursive filter algorithm calculates the Kalman gain $K_t$, which specifies the degree to which the measurement $z_t$ is to be incorporated into the new state estimate.\n",
